Backup and system setup tools

Things they do:




 - **rclone_check_remotes.sh :**   Report on the usage of all rclone remotes
 - **rsync_to_host.sh        :**   Directly sync folders from current to a remote
 - **system_info.sh          :**   Gather info of a system in order to be able to reconfigure it



*Suggestions and improvements are always welcome.*

*I use those regular, but they have their quirks, may broke and maybe superseded by other tools.*
