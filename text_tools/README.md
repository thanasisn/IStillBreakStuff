Tools for processing text or text files and creating documents.


- **count_word_frequency.sh :**   Count word frequency

- **md_build.sh             :**   Build md files to multiple output formats



*Suggestions and improvements are always welcome.*

*I use those regular, but they have their quirks, may broke and maybe superseded by other tools.*
