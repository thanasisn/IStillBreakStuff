# bash templates 

Code blocks, one-liners and snippets for shell files 

Things they do:



- **template_bash.sh    :**   Auto generated bash script template by './system_tools/new_bash.sh'
- **template_logging.sh :**   A standardized logging method for bash


*Suggestions and improvements are always welcome.*

*I use those regular, but they have their quirks, may broke and maybe superseded by other tools.*
