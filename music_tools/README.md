Music library management tools.


- **convert_m3u_playlists.sh      :** Convert mp3 play list from master library to image library
- **flac_cue_split.sh             :** Split and add metadata to flac files from cue list
- **music_library_imag_check.sh   :**  Music library image maintenance
- **transcode_library.sh          :** Transcode music library image from FLAC to mp3


*Suggestions and improvements are always welcome.*

*I use those regular, but they have their quirks, may broke and maybe superseded by other tools.*
