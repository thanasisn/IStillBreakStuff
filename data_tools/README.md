- **parse_xml_phone_logs.R :**   Parse xml logs from phone

- **textualise.sh          :**   Extract text from pdf, doc, djv, and text files, for analysis and fingerprinting with other tools


*Suggestions and improvements are always welcome.*

*I use those regular, but they have their quirks, may broke and maybe superseded by other tools.*
