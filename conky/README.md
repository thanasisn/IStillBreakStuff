This is desktop information and status system I use on my desktops.

- Uses different scripts to collect data.
- Uses crontab for updating content.
- Many data are exported from other scripts while running.
- It collects and display things I am interested in.
- Probably it will be difficult to run as is.




*Suggestions and improvements are always welcome.*

*I use those regular, but they have their quirks, may broke and maybe superseded by other tools.*
